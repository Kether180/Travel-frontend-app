          Mount Roraima or in Spanish Cerro Roraima;) is the highest of the
          Pakaraima chain of tepuis (table-top mountain) or plateaux in South
          America.<br />
          The mountain also serves as the tripoint of Venezuela, Guayana
          Esequiba and Brazil. Mount Roraima lies on the Guiana Shield in the
          southeastern
          <br />
          corner of Venezuela's 30,000-square-kilometre (12,000-square-mile)
          Canaima National Park forming the highest peak of Guayana's Highland
          Range. <br />

        <p>
          The highest point in Guayana Esequiba and the highest point of the
          Brazilian state of Roraima lie on the plateau, but Venezuela and
          Brazil have <br />
          higher mountains elsewhere.85% of this tepui is in Venezuelan
          territory (Bolívar state), with 10% in the territory of Guayana
          Esequiba. <br />

          "Machu Picchu Mountain" Mountain is situated at 3061masl. This
          mountain offers its visitors one of the best panoramic views of Machu
          Picchu citadel and of Vilcanota (or Wilcamayu) river whose waters,
          despite the distance, you can listen to hitting the rocks. The trail
          to Machu Picchu Mountain is ascending through steps made of stone and
          well-established paths. The walk is not really dangerous, nor
          difficult to perform, but it will require all your strength. During
          the walk, you can observe how the citadel of Machu Picchu and Huayna
          Picchu will remain lower and lower; moreover, you can contemplate the
          exuberant vegetation, where the famous orchids stand out (there are
          more than 425 species of orchids in Machu Picchu) . The amazing view
          from the top of this mountain and its colorful path make it the
          perfect option for adventurers and lovers of nature, moreover it is
          the best alternative if you cannot climb the other mountain, Wayna
          Picchu, whether for lack of space availability or physical
          difficulties.

          “Machu Picchu Mountain” Mountain must have been a path used a lot by
          the Incas, especially for military purposes, since you have a 360
          degrees view of the whole valley, which allows emitting an early
          warning before any threat of invasion of another adjoining culture.
          Because of its location, it could also be used for astronomical
          purposes, to study the cosmos. Actually, it is an important
          alternative of travel in the archeological park of Machu Picchu and
          receives hundreds of visitors each day. Machu Picchu Mountain has
          easier access than Wayna Picchu.

          The Temple Complex was constructed from 1406 to 1420 during the reign
          of the Yongle Emperor of Ming Dynasty, who was also responsible for
          the construction <br />of the Forbidden City in Beijing. It is
          currently located in Dongcheng Beijing, China. The complex was
          extended and renamed Temple of Heaven during the reign of the <br />
          Jiajing Emperor in the 16th century. The complex was visited by the
          Emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties for annual ceremonies of
          prayer to Heaven for a good harvest.

        <p>
          There are also three other prominent temples built in Beijing, the
          Temple of the Sun (日壇) in the east, the Temple of Earth (地壇) in
          the north, and the Temple of Moon (月壇) in the west. <br />
          The Temple of Heaven was renovated in the 18th century under the
          Qianlong Emperor. By then, the state budget was insufficient, so this
          was the last large-scale renovation of the temple <br />
          complex in imperial times.

          Mount Everest is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in
          the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas.<br />
          The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point. The current
          official elevation of 8,848 m (29,029 ft), recognised<br />
          by China and Nepal, was established by a 1955 Indian survey and
          confirmed by a 1975 Chinese survey. In 1865, <br />
          Everest was given its official English name by the Royal Geographical
          Society, as recommended by Andrew Waugh,<br />
          the British Surveyor General of India, who chose the name of his
          predecessor in the post, Sir George Everest,<br />
          despite Everest's objections.Mount Everest attracts many climbers,
          some of them highly experienced mountaineers. <br />
          There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from
          the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route")<br />
          and the other from the north in Tibet.<br />

          summit (at 3,718 m (12,198 ft)) is the highest <br />
          point in Spain and the highest point above sea level in the islands of
          the Atlantic. If measured from the ocean floor, it is at 7,500 m

        Copenhagen (Danish: København) is the capital and most populous city of
        Denmark.<br />
        For a number of years, Copenhagen has ranked high in international
        surveys for its quality of life. Its stable economy together with its
        education services and level of social safety make it attractive for
        locals and visitors alike. Although it is one of the world's most
        expensive cities, it is also one of the most liveable with its public
        transport, facilities for cyclists and its environmental policies.
        In elevating Copenhagen to "most liveable city" in 2013, Monocle pointed
        to its open spaces, increasing activity on the streets, city planning in
        favour of cyclists and pedestrians, and features to encourage
        inhabitants to enjoy city life with an emphasis on community, culture
        and cuisine. Other sources have ranked Copenhagen high for its
        business environment, accessibility, restaurants and environmental
        planning. <br /> </p>
