      THE TEMPLE OF HEAVEN (天坛 Tiāntán) Beijing - China

    <div class="about  text-white text">
      <p>
        The Temple Complex was constructed from 1406 to 1420 during the reign of
        the Yongle Emperor of Ming Dynasty, who was also responsible for the
        construction <br />of the Forbidden City in Beijing. It is currently
        located in Dongcheng Beijing, China. The complex was extended and
        renamed Temple of Heaven during the reign of the <br />
        Jiajing Emperor in the 16th century. The complex was visited by the
        Emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties for annual ceremonies of prayer
        to Heaven for a good harvest.

        <p>
          There are also three other prominent temples built in Beijing, the
          Temple of the Sun (日壇) in the east, the Temple of Earth (地壇) in
          the north, and the Temple of Moon (月壇) in the west. <br />
          The Temple of Heaven was renovated in the 18th century under the
          Qianlong Emperor. By then, the state budget was insufficient, so this
          was the last large-scale renovation of the temple <br />
          complex in imperial times.

        TThe Potala Palace is a dzong fortress in the city of Lhasa, in Tibet.
        <br />
        It was the winter palace of the Dalai Lamas from 1649 to 1959, has been
        <br />
        a museum since then, and is a World Heritage Site since 1994. The palace
        <br />
        is named after Mount Potalaka, the mythical abode of the bodhisattva
        <br />
        Avalokiteśvara.The 5th Dalai Lama started its construction in 1645 after
        <br />
        one of his spiritual advisers, Konchog Chophel (died 1646), pointed
        <br />
        out that the site was ideal as a seat of government, situated as it
        <br />
        is between Drepung and Sera monasteries and the old city of Lhasa.
        <br />
        It may overlay the remains of an earlier fortress called the White
        <br />
        or Red Palace on the site, built by Songtsen Gampo in 637. <br />

          Mount Everest is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in
          the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas.<br />
          The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point. The current
          official elevation of 8,848 m (29,029 ft), recognised<br />
          by China and Nepal, was established by a 1955 Indian survey and
          confirmed by a 1975 Chinese survey. In 1865, <br />
          Everest was given its official English name by the Royal Geographical
          Society, as recommended by Andrew Waugh,<br />
          the British Surveyor General of India, who chose the name of his
          predecessor in the post, Sir George Everest,<br />
          despite Everest's objections.Mount Everest attracts many climbers,
          some of them highly experienced mountaineers. <br />
          There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from
          the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route")<br />
          and the other from the north in Tibet.<br />

        The Playa de Las Teresitas is an artificial, white sand, tourist beach
        located north of the village of San Andrés, Santa Cruz de Tenerife in
        Tenerife,<br />
        Spain.Originally the area of the beach consisted mostly of stone and
        rocks, with a small strip of black sand.It was divided into three
        distinct <br />
        parts that had different names: Tras la Arena, closest to San Andrés;
        Los Moros in the middle; and finally the area bounded by the ravine of
        Las Teresas.<br />
        There was a private spa in the middle of the beach, and the area was
        also used for surfing. Above the beach were farms and orchards, growing
        bananas,<br />
        mangoes, tomatoes and avocados, that provided the town with most of its
        income at the time.<br />

          Mount Teide (Spanish: El Teide, Pico del Teide, pronounced, "Teide
          Peak") is a volcano on Tenerife in the Canary Islands, Spain. Its
          summit (at 3,718 m (12,198 ft)) is the highest <br />
          point in Spain and the highest point above sea level in the islands of
          the Atlantic. If measured from the ocean floor, it is at 7,500 m
          (24,600 ft) the fourth-highest volcano <br />
          in the world, and is described by UNESCO and NASA as Earth's
          third-tallest volcanic structure. Teide's elevation above sea level
          makes Tenerife the tenth highest island in the world.
